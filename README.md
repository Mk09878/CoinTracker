# CoinTracker
A native android app written in Java that has the following functionalities:
1. Fetch the price history over time and display a line graph of the same.
2. Displays two tables (Recycler View) of order book information (bids and asks)
3. Takes price input from the user and stores it in a text file. Pings the api every hour using a service and displays a notification
   if the current bitcoin price has fallen below the specified price entered by the user.
     
## Improvements
1. Could handle configuration changes
2. Could use RxJava
3. Could implement the app in kotlin
